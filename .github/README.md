# My dotfiles

My half-baked attempt at cuteness. I may retry with hyprland or awesomewm someday...

# Installation

The installation of this dotfiles consists of 2 steps:

## Step 1: Clone

You may clone this branch with this command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iluvgirlswithglasses/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
git checkout cute-light
```

## Step 2: Copy Files

Once you've done the previous step, just copy everything in this repository to the home directory. Dependencies are:

```sh
sudo apt install fonts-comic-neue kitty fish i3 feh rofi polybar xsel compton picom gtk3-nocsd flameshot pipewire
```

Additional customizations:

- If you want to customize the private firefox page as I previously showcased, refer to `.mozilla`.
- It is strongly recommended to have Nerd Fonts installed. If you use Debian, I suggest you install them via [this repository](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

That should be all.

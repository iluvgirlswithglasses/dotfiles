# My dotfiles

My half-baked attempt at cuteness. I may retry with awesomewm someday...

# Showcase

TODOs:
1. Make a GTK theme
2. Make a better bar with awesomewm (i3 autokills empty workspaces, which make the "butterfly" workspace indicator impractical)
3. This browser is boring, make a better browser rice (may just adapt [shyfox](https://github.com/iluvgirlswithglasses/shyfox))
4. Make a menu for calendar and notifications and other stuffs (also with awesomewm)

# Installation

The installation of this dotfiles consists of 2 steps:

## Step 1: Clone

You may clone this branch with this command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iluvgirlswithglasses/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
git checkout cute-light
```

## Step 2: Copy Files

Once you've done the previous step, just copy everything in this repository to the home directory. Dependencies are:

```sh
sudo apt install fonts-comic-neue kitty fish i3 feh rofi polybar xsel picom gtk3-nocsd flameshot pipewire playerctl
```

Additional customizations:

- If you want to customize the private firefox page as I previously showcased, refer to `.mozilla`.
- It is strongly recommended to have Nerd Fonts installed. If you use Debian, I suggest you install them via [this repository](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

That should be all.
